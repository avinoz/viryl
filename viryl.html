                    <p>Chad’s unique background combines a history of entrepreneurship in the record industry and technical experience within the medical device industry. As a founder of the record label Ultrasound Recordings and former owner/operator of Toronto-based record pressing plant Acme Vinyl, Chad carries first-hand experience of the challenges that have plagued record pressing over the last decade. Through his years running Acme, he gained a wealth of expertise in maintaining, rebuilding, and operating vintage record presses. After closing Acme in 2007, he put his Biomedical and Software Engineering education to use as a lead member of the technical service and support team of the successful Toronto-based medical device start-up Sentinelle Medical, Inc. Chad’s vision of the solutions desperately needed by pressing facilities around the world and ability to deliver them is truly rare.</p>
