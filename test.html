As a founder of the record label Ultrasound Recordings and former owner and operator of Toronto-based record pressing plant Acme Vinyl, Chad carries first-hand experience of the challenges that have plagued record pressing over the last decade. After closing Acme in 2007, he put his biomedical and software engineering education to use at the Toronto-based medical device start-up Sentinelle Medical, Inc. Chad has a rare vision of both the solutions desperately needed by pressing facilities around the world and what it takes to deliver them.</h6>
